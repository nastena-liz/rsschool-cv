# Summary

I work as an economist, but now i'm attending courses (unfortunately, most of them are free) to change the job. This is my dream and my life goal for further some years. I want to become a frontend developer. I find it interesting, because my furute work will help people to use apps more effectively (it comes from my own experience, when it's hard to use any app because some processes are illogical).
I want to try smth new, to have a flexible schedule of work to enjoy my life and to be more productive. I want to get knowledge and skills that will be enough for employment in a company.
